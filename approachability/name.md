# Name

Names are powerful things.

Whether earned or not, Haskell has a reputation for being difficult to learn, and with a less than welcoming community.

A name that's friendly, playful, and suggests imagery sets a good precedent for a community. Ideally it should be expressible in pictures or emoji, be punnable, and suggest other memetic hooks.
